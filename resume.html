As an air duct cleaner I would take down all the vent registers, blast each duct from the main trunk back to the register inorder to get rid of all dust and debris. If there is mold in the duct I would then have to thoroughly clean while being gentle to the duct work. After all vents are cleared, the air handler would then be cleaned.
